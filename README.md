This article introduces a professional chat robot: Doraemon, which can answer 
questions related to finance. We create a financial corpus and train Doraemon to 
make it a professional financial professional coach. Through Python software, 
using the seq2seq method, a 3-layer long-short-term recurrent neural network is 
selected as the encoder and decoder, and the framework chooses Keras. In 
addition, we use another daily conversational robot built with pytorch as a 
comparison. In fact, because we limit some of Doraemon's answers, the model 
results are more stable than daily conversational robots. In this report, we first 
introduce our timeline and reflect on two of these articles; then, introduce the 
theory of the project; besides, will guide you through the steps and results of 
building a financial chat robot; whatâ€™s more, suggestions for comprehensive and 
further research; and finally, personal contributions and references are listed.

Here are 2 chatbots, one is 'movie':a conversational chatbot, the other is 'final': a chatbot on finance.
I have to emphasize that the 'movie' chatbot is just a contrast to the 'final', and it is an existing implementation, not created by us.

You have to install required packages and environment like keras and pytorch to run the code.

You just need to run the main function to complete the whole running, remember to set the correct path.
